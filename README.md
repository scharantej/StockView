 ## Flask Application Design for Stock Comparison Web App

### HTML Files

**1. index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that will serve as the user interface for the web app.
- It will include the necessary HTML elements to display the stock comparison chart, table, and current stock prices.
- The HTML code should be structured to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing layout.

**2. base.html**
- This HTML file will serve as the base template for all other HTML files in the application.
- It will contain common elements such as the header, footer, and navigation bar.
- By using a base template, we can ensure consistency across all pages of the web app.

### Routes

**1. @app.route('/')**
- This route will handle the root URL of the web app.
- It will render the index.html file, which will display the stock comparison chart, table, and current stock prices.

**2. @app.route('/data')**
- This route will handle the request for stock data.
- It will fetch the necessary stock data from an external source (e.g., Yahoo Finance API) and return it in a JSON format.
- The JavaScript code in the index.html file will consume this data to populate the chart and table.

**3. @app.route('/about')**
- This route will handle the request for the about page of the web app.
- It will render a separate HTML file that provides information about the web app, its purpose, and its creators.

### Additional Considerations

- The Flask application should include a static folder to store CSS and JavaScript files.
- The application should implement error handling to gracefully handle any unexpected errors that may occur.
- The application should be deployed to a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to make it accessible over the internet.
